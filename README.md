# phonenumbers
Python is a very powerful language and also very rich in libraries. Phonenumbers are one of the modules that provides numerous features like providing basic information about a phone number, validation of a phone number etc. Here, we will learn how to use phonenumbers module just by writing simple Python programs.   Some of the use cases are,  Get Timezone: Here is the simple Python program to get the timezone of a phone number using phonenumbers module. First, we do parse the string input to phonenumber format, and then we use an inbuilt function to get the timezone of a user. It gives the output for valid numbers only,so do check if there is no relevant output. ex: timezone.time_zones_for_number(mobileNumber)  Carrier and Region of a Phone Number: Here we will learn how to find the carrier and region of a phone number using the geocoder and carrier functions of this module.Here we can choose multiple languages to display the result. ex for carrier : carrier.name_for_number(mobileNumber, "en") ex for region: geocoder.description_for_number(mobileNumber, "hi")  Validation of a phone number: A simple python program, to check whether a given phone number is valid or not (e.g. itâ€™s in an assigned exchange), and to check whether a given phone number is possible or not (e.g. it has the right number of digits). ex: phonenumbers.is_valid_number (mobileNumber)
